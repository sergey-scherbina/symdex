# symdex

**Structural code intelligence for coding agents** — what a codebase *is*
(definitions, references, callers, implementations, which `given` a call
site resolves, which modules depend on which), precomputed and served over
MCP, so an agent asks instead of grepping.

Scala first, through the compiler's own output: **SemanticDB** — every
occurrence of every symbol, what each symbol is, and which given every
call site resolved — and **TASTy** for where each definition's body ends
and which methods are extensions. Java through the same SemanticDB
(scip-java's javac plugin writes it). Other languages through the **SCIP**
indexes their own indexers write (scip-typescript, scip-python,
rust-analyzer, scip-clang): drop an `index.scip` under the root. symdex
writes no per-language analyzer.

Built on [okay](https://github.com/sergey-scherbina/okay): its MCP server
and JSON codec; what symdex needs that is general goes into okay.

**[GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md)** is the user guide: every tool with a real example,
settings, the hook, Java and SCIP, troubleshooting, and the literature.

## How it relates to

- **[Quill](https://github.com/treblereel/quill)** — the same idea for Java,
  from bytecode (Jandex) into SQLite, 50+ MCP tools. Bytecode loses what
  matters in Scala (givens and their resolution, extension methods, opaque
  types, inline), so symdex reads TASTy; and it keeps the tool count small,
  because every tool is context an agent pays for.
- **[rozum](https://github.com/sergey-scherbina/rozum)** — its `rag.search`
  is RETRIEVAL: syntactic chunks ranked by BM25 and embeddings, for
  questions grep loses (a concept, a symptom). symdex is STRUCTURE: exact
  answers to "who calls this", "what implements that". The two complement.

## Tools

| tool | answers |
|---|---|
| `definition` | where a symbol is defined, with its doc comment and signature lines |
| `references` | every use, resolved by the compiler; `callers` groups them by enclosing definition |
| `implementations` | subtypes, overriders, anonymous `new T { … }`, given instances of a type class |
| `givens` | what the compiler inserted at a line: which given each call resolved |
| `members` | declared and inherited members |
| `modules` | which modules use which, and what a change reaches |
| `outline` | a file's definitions, one line each: what is in it, without reading it |
| `source` | one definition's text, not its file |
| `more` | a page of an answer that was too long and was archived |
| `status` | the index's generation, age, coverage, and sources edited since compiled |

Every answer has a size budget (8 000 characters by default). Over it, an
answer is compressed to its header, the files it names, and its first lines,
all copied from the answer itself. The whole answer is archived, and `more`
pages through it. Exact reads such as `source` are paged, never summarized.
That is the "context diet" applied to a code index, without a model in the
loop: specs/symdex.md, "Context diet".

Tool schemas cost context on every turn: `serve --tools definition,references,source,outline --lean`
serves four terse tools for about 335 tokens instead of about 1 517 for all ten.
`status` shows both numbers.

A query is a name (`joinSorted`, `Bulk.joinSorted`), a SemanticDB symbol
(`okay/Bulk#joinSorted().`) or a position (`Tables.scala:188:60`). A name
that means several symbols is answered with the candidates.

## Use

In the project, `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.url("symdex", url("https://sergey-scherbina.github.io/symdex"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
addSbtPlugin("io.github.sergey-scherbina" % "sbt-symdex" % "0.5.0")
```

then, once:

```sh
sbt symdexIndex symdexMcp symdexHook
```

- the plugin turns SemanticDB on for every project, and fetches symdex itself — the
  GitHub release of its version, downloaded once into `~/.symdex/<version>` (or a
  checkout named by `SYMDEX_HOME`)
- `symdexIndex` compiles every project with its tests and reports what is covered
  and what is stale
- `symdexMcp` adds the server to `.mcp.json`; `symdexHook` adds the hook below to
  `.claude/settings.local.json`. Both merge into what is there and never remove anything.
  `symdexTools := Seq(...)` and `symdexLean := true` make the server cheaper
- from the sbt shell, any time: `symdex references query=Foo.bar callers=true`

The server is not run inside sbt — an MCP client starts it as its own process — and
needs no compile hook: it notices a compile from the SemanticDB it rewrites.

Without sbt: unzip a [release](https://github.com/sergey-scherbina/symdex/releases)
and run `symdex/bin/symdex serve --root <project>` (Java 17+), after compiling the
project with `semanticdbEnabled := true`. From this checkout, `bin/symdex` does the
same and stages itself with sbt the first time.

## The hook

`bin/symdex-hook` is a Claude Code PostToolUse hook: a large search or test
output (3 500+ tokens) is replaced by an exact digest of itself — the files it
names with a count each, its first hits, or a log's head, tail and error lines —
and the whole output is archived in `.symdex/archive` for the agent to read back.
No model writes the digest, so it cannot invent a path. Exact reads and diffs
are never touched. In `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{"hooks": {"PostToolUse": [{"matcher": "Bash|Grep",
  "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/Users/you/.symdex/0.5.0/symdex/bin/symdex-hook"}]}]}}
```

## Build

`git clone --recursive`, then `sbt test`. okay is a submodule.
